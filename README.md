# Which AI model writes the best code?

You can read the blog posts here: 

* [Which AI model writes the best R code?](https://posit.co/blog/r-llm-evaluation/)
* [Which AI models writes the best Pandas code?](https://posit.co/blog/python-llm-evaluation/)

`eval.R` contains the evaluation code for the R post. `eval.py` contains the evaluation code for the Python post. 

Note that if you want to run the code yourself, you will need to set up OpenAI and Anthropic API keys. You can learn more on the [ellmer package site](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/#authentication).
